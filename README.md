# Komoot

Using Selenium with Java and a website of your choosing (i would suggest https://www.komoot.com/, because of easily identifiable objects), please, automate a maximum of 5 test cases, which use/showcase the following techniques/features/requirements:

- test dynamic content
- apply the concept of widgets(be careful, because it comes from appium!!!)
- if you have a list of contact names, which has more entries than can fit on one page(you have to load more contacts to see them) and can be sorted by family name or by first name. Verify that - both sorting options work.
- make sure that your tests modify data during execution, but still retain their scalability.
 
The requirements for a successfully finished task are:

- Code is written in Java with TestNG and Gradle!
- You use PageObject/PageFactory Structure
- There is documentation for your automation(software, hardware and configuration prerequisites for running the tests; how to run the tests; etc.) in the form of a README.MD file
- add step by step description of your test cases in separate text files.
- You publish your code on GitHub
- your push your code to GitHub at latest starting with the first out of three test cases, which you implemented.(so that we can see the commit history)
- Your code can be executed according to the the documentation in the README.MD
- Tests are all green, unless there is a bug in the app.
